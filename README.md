## Introduction

Genetic algorithms are optimization algorithms inspired by natural selection. This repository includes two projects showcasing their applications:

1. **Maze Solver**: Finds the shortest path through a maze.
2. **Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP)**: Optimizes routes for a fleet of vehicles.

## Projects

### Maze Solver

This project uses a genetic algorithm to solve a maze by finding the shortest path from the start to the end.

- **Notebook**: [Genetic_Algos_Maze_Solver.ipynb](Genetic_Algos_Maze_Solver.ipynb)
- **Description**: This notebook includes implementation details, visualizations, and results.

### Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP)

This project applies a genetic algorithm to optimize vehicle routes, minimizing the total distance traveled.

- **Notebook**: [Genetic_Algos_Vehicle_Routing_Problem.ipynb](Genetic_Algos_Vehicle_Routing_Problem.ipynb)
- **Description**: This notebook contains the problem setup, algorithm implementation, and results.

## Installation

To run the notebooks, you need Python and Jupyter Notebook installed. Install the required libraries using `pip`:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/sharad-mishra/Genetic-Algos.git
    cd Genetic-Algos
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required packages:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

To run the notebooks:

1. Start Jupyter Notebook:
    ```sh
    jupyter notebook
    ```

2. Open the relevant notebook (e.g., `Genetic_Algos_Maze_Solver.ipynb` or `Genetic_Algos_Vehicle_Routing_Problem.ipynb`).

3. Run the cells to see the genetic algorithm in action.
